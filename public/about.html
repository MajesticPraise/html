<h1>About Me</h1>

</p>
<p> My passion for computer and computer related matters is what prompted me to take on this web development course and by the Grace of God, I am getting what i bargained for.
  Udemy is one of the best learning platform i have come across.
  I started my web development lesson on the 5th of September, 2023, and here i am with my first project.

<p> My favourite bible passage is <i> Rom 9:15-16
  15 For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. 
  16 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.
  </i> Except the Lord helps a man, there is nothing such a man can do by himself, we all come from God and we draw strength from him. TRUST IN THE LORD and all your dreams will come true.</p>
  <p> I love you all but Jesus Loves you more</p>
